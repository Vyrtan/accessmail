Builds for Windows and Linux:

Build for Windows:
The symbolic link in the folder "Windows" can be used to launch the program.
It has been tested on Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7. All 64-bit systems.

Build for Linux:
The executable is located in the Linux/distro/main/ folder called "main".
You can start it using the console command ./main when you are inside the correct
folder.
It has been tested only on Ubuntu 14.04LTS 64-bit and is known to throw errors using
it on older systems. Patches are about to come to fix this compatibility problem.

If you want to initialize the software again you can simply override the "data.db" in
the "distro" folders with the "data.db" from the "build" folder.
